\section{Introduction}

Working of RSA algorithm is heavily based upon computations on primary numbers. Two large prime numbers are generated and speed of generation and validation of these is crucial. Speeding up processes would let us break the RSA.

	In this paper we will present software and hardware assisted implementations of GCD.
