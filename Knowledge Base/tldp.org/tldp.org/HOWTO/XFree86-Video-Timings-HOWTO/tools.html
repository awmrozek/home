>If your monitor was made after 1996, it probably supports the
<A
HREF="http://www.vesa.org/summary/sumeedidrar1.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>EDID</A
>
specification. EDID-capable monitors (sometimes called "Plug'n'Play"
monitors in Microsoft marketing literature) can report their
capabilities to your computer.</P
><P
>Many driver modules in XFree86 4.0 support DDC, the <A
HREF="http://www.vesa.org/dload/summary/sumeddcv1.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>VESA Display
Data Channel facility</A
>.  A DDC-enabled graphics-card module
will ask the monitor to hand it an EDID capability description and
configure itself from that data.  So with 4.0 and any recent monitor,
you are likely not to have to do any configuration at all.</P
><P
>If your graphics-card module happens not to be DDC-enabled but
your monitor speaks EDID, you can still use the read-edid program to
ask the monitor for its statistics and compute a mode line for you.
See the <A
HREF="http://john.fremlin.de/programs/linux/read-edid/"
TARGET="_top"
>read-edid home
page</A
>.</P
><P
>Starting with XFree86 3.2, XFree86 provided an
<B
CLASS="command"
>XF86Setup</B
> program that makes it easy to generate
a working monitor mode interactively, without messing with video
timing numbers directly.  So you shouldn't actually need to calculate a
base monitor mode in most cases.  Unfortunately,
<B
CLASS="command"
>XF86Setup</B
> has some limitations; it only knows
about standard video modes up to 1280x1024.  If you have a very
high-performance monitor capable of 1600x1200 or more you will still
have to compute your base monitor mode yourself.</P
><P
>There is a KDE tool called <A
HREF="http://paranoia.rulez.org/videogen/"
TARGET="_top"
>KVideoGen</A
> that
computes modelines from basic monitor and card statistics.  I've
experimented with generating modelines from it, but haven't tried them
in live use.  Note that its horizontal and vertical `refresh rate'
parameters are the same as the sync frequencies HSF and VSF we
describe below.  The `horizontal sync pulse' number seems to be a sync
pulse width in microseconds, HSP (with the tool assuming fixed `front
porch' HGT1 and `back porch' HGT2 values).  If you don't know the
`horizontal sync pulse' number it's safe to use the default.</P
><P
>Another XFree86 modeline generator lives <A
HREF="http://zaph.com/Modeline"
TARGET="_top"
>here</A
>.  You can either download
the Python script or use the CGI form provided.</P
><P
>Recent versions of XFree86 provide a tool called
<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>xvidtune</SPAN
> which you will probably find quite useful
for testing and tuning monitor modes.  It begins with a gruesome
warning about the possible consequences of mistakes with it.  If you
pay careful attention to this document and learn what is behind the
pretty numbers in xvidtune's boxes, you will become able to use
xvidtune effectively and with confidence.</P
><P
>If you have <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>xvidtune</SPAN
>(1), you'll be able to
test new modes on the fly, without modifying your X configuration
files or even rebooting your X server.  Otherwise, XFree86 allows you
to hot-key between different modes defined in Xconfig (see XFree86.man
for details).  Use this capabilty to save yourself hassles!  When you
want to test a new mode, give it a unique mode label and add it to the
<EM
>end</EM
> of your hot-key list.  Leave a known-good
mode as the default to fall back on if the test mode doesn't work.</P
><P
>Towards the end of this document, we include a `modeplot' script that
you can use to produce an analog graph of available modes.  This is
not directly helpful for generating modelines, but it may help you
better understand the relationships that define them.</P
