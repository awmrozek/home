<H2><A NAME="ss24.1">24.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc24.1">Replacing pre 1990 UARTS</A>
</H2>

<P> Many 486 PCs (old) and all Pentiums (or the like) should have
modern 16550As (usually called just 16550's) with FIFOs.  If you have
something really old (pre 1990), the chip may unplug so that you may
be able to upgrade by finding a plug-in 16550A chip and replacing your
existing 16450 UART.  If the functionality has been built into another
type of chip, you are out of luck.  If the UART is socketed, then
upgrading would be easy if you could find a replacement.  The new and
old are pin-to-pin compatible.  It may be more feasible to just buy a
new serial card on the Internet (few retail stores stock them today)
or find a used one.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss24.2">24.2</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc24.2">Two Ports with the Same IO address</A>
</H2>

<P>Modern kernels should not allow the opening of ports with the same
IO address.  But one may probe for ports even though they are not
open.  If two ports have the same IO address then old fashioned
probing by sending commands to the address  will erroneously indicate
only one port.  But modem device detection at boot-time should
discover both ports and report the conflict.  In olden days, all sorts
of errors were reported/observed for devices illegally attempting to
use the same IO address.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-12.html#probing_ss">Probing</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss24.3">24.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc24.3">Configuring by modifying source code</A>
</H2>

<P>In the past, to get a certain serial port supported, one might need
to modify the C source code, perhaps by adding a #define to it.
Today, the use modules for multiport cards, use of parameters for
modules or the kernel, or the use of configuration options should
handle all cases.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss24.4">24.4</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc24.4">Modems on Multiport Cards Obsolete for Sending at 56k</A>
</H2>

<P>For a modem to transmit at nearly 56k requires that it be a special
digital modem and have a digital connection to a digital phone line
(such as a T1 line).  Modems used with serial cards (the modems may
either be on the serial card or on another card) normally have no such
digital connection so they can't be used at the 56k speed, and thus
are obsolete unless one doesn't need to send at 56k.  In other words
they are obsolete for ISP servers but might be OK for small business
or home use.</P>
<P>An partial exception to the above are modem banks that connect to
multiport serial cards where the modem bank can access multiplexed
digital phone lines.   Thus one could use a multiport serial card with
a few 56k digital modems for sending at 56k.  For both analog and
digital modems there is one modem on each serial port so there needs
to be an external cable (modem bank to multiport) for each modem.
This can lead to a large number of cables.  So it's less clutter (and
cheaper) to use internal modems without a multiport card.  This makes
even this "exception" obsolete for high volume work.  It's somewhat
analogous to the lower cost of an internal modem for a desktop PC as
compared to the higher cost (and more cabling) for an external modem.
