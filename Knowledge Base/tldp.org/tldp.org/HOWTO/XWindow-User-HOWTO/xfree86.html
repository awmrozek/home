 protocol (e.g. PS/2), it should be well supported. Conversely, if it is
 something relatively new, with  ground-breaking technology, the odds 
 are not as good. This is just the nature of the beast with open source 
 development versus manufacturers that cater more to the most popular
 platforms. Some manufacturers are more co-operative than others too.&#13;</P

></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>     Monitors - This is easy. Linux does not really need to be compatible with
     the monitor per se. That is the job of the video card. Any monitor that
     your graphics card can drive should do fine. Including, flat panel 
     monitors.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     Video cards - This is much tougher. The X server is determined by the 
     the chipset. Many, many are supported. But inevitably there are always 
     some newer cards, or even revised cards, that are not. And some may have
     better support and better optimization than others. Advanced
     features such as multi-headed displays, 3D, TV out, DRI, etc., have some
     support as well, though this should be researched first, as the support
     may be limited. Supported cards are listed: <A
HREF="http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://xfree86.org/cardlist.html</A
>.

   </P
><P
>     Open source drivers are often developed incrementally. For instance, a
     particular card may work well for basic display purposes, but specialized 
     features such as 3D may come much later in the development cycle. This
     is a quite different development model than with proprietary drivers from 
     the manufacturer.

   </P

    has long preferred three button mice, though more buttons is supported as
    well. Many wheeled mice have X server support via the
