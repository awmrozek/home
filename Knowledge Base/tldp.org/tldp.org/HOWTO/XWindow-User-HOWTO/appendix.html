>   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X server"</SPAN

   with your video card and other system hardware, and manages the 
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN
> and the various components attached to the
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN
> (keyboard, mouse, etc.). And, of course, handles 
   requests from clients as well. There are different X servers for different
   chipsets.
  </P

>   X Servers are referenced in the form of:
  </P
><P
>   <EM
>host.domain:display_number.screen_number</EM
>
  </P
><P

  </P

>   If host (and domain) is omitted, localhost is assumed. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   can be a remote host. If <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"screen"</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"0"</SPAN
> (the first screen) is assumed. In it's shortest form, the
   X server is often represented as just <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>":0"</SPAN
>, which would be the
   first local <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

CLASS="APPLICATION"

   multiple <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   <SPAN

  </P

CLASS="QUOTE"

  </P

><LI
><P
>    When <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN

    one or more <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN

    have more than one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    common configuration for the average user). Each <SPAN

    a separate instance of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"X"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"

    includes not only the obvious video components, but also the keyboard,
    mouse and other input type components. The user can only access one
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

    monitor. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    <SPAN

    wants when he logs in. Each <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

    unique configuration (e.g. resolution). But again, the most typical 
    configuration is just one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   In reference to X servers, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   output with which you view <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN

   And there can be more than one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"screen"</SPAN
>, just like you can
   have more than one <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"multi-headed displays"</SPAN

   instance. In fact you can even have more than one computer running off a
   single X server. This is beyond the scope of this document, but you should
   be aware of this degree of flexibility as it is an important ingredient of
   the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> protocol.
   
  </P

><LI
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Desktop"</SPAN

    contexts. Often, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktop"</SPAN

    called the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Desktop Environment"</SPAN

    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KDE</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME</SPAN

    as well-known <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDE</SPAN
>, which are high level
    applications that control much of how the user interacts with the
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN

    feel, as well as consistent configuration and come bundled with their own
    set of utilities for common tasks.
  </P
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Desktop"</SPAN
> also sometimes just means the viewable screen area.
   This is more of the MS Window's meaning. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
>
   environments though are capable of having multiple virtual
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktops"</SPAN
> that can be switched between as needed. This helps with
   organizing different tasks. Each <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktop"</SPAN
> may its own windows
   and clients that are specific to it. Right now I have seven
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>WindowMaker</SPAN
> desktops
   (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>WindowMaker</SPAN
> calls them
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"WorkSpaces"</SPAN
>), and one of those I have dedicated to writing
   this document. This <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"desktop"</SPAN
> has thirteen unique windows at
   the moment (man pages, browser windows, clock, gvim, xterms, etc).
  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Clients"</SPAN
> are any program that connect to the X server, and
   require an X server for some task (e.g. to display itself). Often, these
   are displayed in their own <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window"</SPAN
>, but not always. For
   instance, if I use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CTRL-N</TT
> to open a new
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Mozilla</SPAN
> window, this is one
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> client but with two windows. If I run a command
   line <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> utility like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xev</B
> to
   view key and mouse events, this runs in the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xterm's</B
>
   window, so has none of its own, but is still a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"client"</SPAN
>.
   Clients can be locally running applications, or applications that are
   running on another system over the network, but are displayed locally.

   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Window Manager"</SPAN
> is a special type of client application 
   and a user definable component of the GUI. It is what the user interacts
   with to a large extent. The Window Manager provides such functionality as
   window borders and decorations, menus, icons, virtual desktops, button
   bars, tool bars, and allows the user to customize these. It is technically
   possible to run <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> without a window manager
   (though not very functional), but not the other way around. Window managers
   should not be confused with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Desktop Environments"</SPAN
> like
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KDE</SPAN
>. Desktop Environments include their own
   preferred Window Manager, but this is a configurable. There is some
   overlapping of responsibilities between Window Managers and Desktop
   Environments.

   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"root window"</SPAN
> is the background of your screen. It is
   referred to as a window in name alone, it does not behave like any other
   window, but rather you run your applications on the root window, or put an
   image on it, or perhaps just a solid color. All other windows are children 
   of this parent window. The root window conceivably can be larger than the viewable 
   screen area.
  </P

><LI
><P
>  
   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"pointer"</SPAN
> is the arrow or indicator of any
   given shape which represents the location of your mouse, or other pointing
   device. The pointer often changes to give you contextual feedback as to
   what will happen when you use the mouse at that point on the screen. 
  </P

><LI
><P
>  
   The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"window"</SPAN
> is a frame in which any given application runs
   and which is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"managed"</SPAN
> by the Window Manager. This includes
   pretty much anything except the so-called root window. Even windows which
   do not appear to have frames, titles, or normal borders of any kind are
   being managed by your window manger. The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"active window"</SPAN
> is
   the window you are currently using. This window will will respond to the
   keyboard when you type, and is traditionally denoted by the fact that your
   mouse cursor is pointing at it, though this is not always the case. The
   active window is said to have <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"focus"</SPAN
>. Most Window Managers
   will somehow highlight the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"active"</SPAN
>, or focused, window to
   differentiate it from other windows.

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Menus"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"icons"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"

   behave in <SPAN

   other windowing systems, and the same general principles apply.

   Windows that run text only applications are called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"terminal
   emulators"</SPAN
>, such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xterm</B
> and various 
   similar applications. This is the well-known <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"command line"</SPAN
> in
   an X environment. These basically emulate a console text-only display, and
   have some advantages due to their being used in
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
>. These are much more complex and sophisticated
   applications than a simple <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>DOS</SPAN
> box on Windows.

   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Widgets"</SPAN

   components as buttons, sliders, menus, scrollbars, listboxes, checkboxes, etc.
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Toolkits"</SPAN

   with the same look and feel. Some common examples are
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GTK+</SPAN

>GNOME</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Xaw</SPAN

   (X Athena Widget set), <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tk</SPAN
>,
   <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Motif</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>QT</SPAN
> (used
   by <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KDE</SPAN

   or another. Sometimes the same application can be built with different
   toolkits, depending on compile time options.

>    Window <SPAN

CLASS="LITERAL"
>WIDTH x HEIGHT +VERT_OFFSET
    +HORZ_OFFSET</TT
