NAME="PERFORMANCE">9. Performance Considerations</H1
><P
> As has been discussed, what we call <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
>, is actually
 a convergence of various components: X server, Window Manager, Desktop, etc.
 With MS Windows, the GUI desktop is tightly integrated with the operating
 system itself. This is not the case in Linux which follows the Unix tradition
 of combining various independent components to achieve some end result. So we
 have choices with each component and it's attendant configuration and
 implementation. In short, much flexibility. This is where you come in. You
 can try various possibilities and decide what you gives you the most bang for
 the buck.&#13;</P
><P
> On low end hardware, this gives us much latitude to decrease the demand on
 available system resources. This is good because, if given the opportunity,
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> can be quite greedy with system resources. If
 you've recently installed a new Linux distribution, you've probably been
 given a default Desktop with many bells and whistles. And something
 that will probably need a fair amount of memory and CPU to achieve a
 reasonable level of performance. If you have the horse power, this should not
 be a problem.&#13;</P
><P
> It is often said that Linux functions very well with relatively little
 memory. This is true to a point. It does not mean though that every possible
 configuration will run with low memory. So if you want to use memory hungry
 applications, then you will have to have the memory. Or you will have to make
 sacrifices to achieve a satisfactory level of performance. It is quite
 possible to run <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> with reasonable performance on
 16 Meg of RAM, and even less if you really want to push it. But you would
 have to live with some real limitations.&#13;</P
><P
> Let's look at some of the components and ways to decrease the demand on
 system resources, in case you are at the low end on hardware, or performance
 is not up to expectations.</P

 </P

><LI
><P
> Graphics cards are of course necessary, and the X server's video performance
 is tied to the card's chipset, and the corresponding XFree86 driver. Just
 because a given card is supported by XFree86 does not necessarily mean it is
 as well optimized as other cards! It may also perform better at a lower color
 depth (see below). It may well be worth the trip to xfree86.org to see if
 there are any notes related to your card with respect to performance or other
 issues.

 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>  And you might try other versions of XFree86. At this time v4.2 was just
  recently released. Some cards may still perform better with 3.3.6 due to the
  way v4.x is being incrementally developed. If you are using x4.x and
  performance is not good, then make sure you are using the latest available
  version.

><P
> The more memory, the better. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN

 caching to help performance. But caching requires memory, and if there isn't
 much to start with, then we would need to reduce memory requirements. Some
 tips for those with low memory or performance problems:</P
><P
> <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
> Use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>free</B
> command to make sure all memory and swap is
 recognized. 

 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Make sure you don't have other system services that are hogging memory or
 CPU. Use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>top</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ps</B
> to see what is
 running, and disable anything you can to free up memory and CPU. Again, a
 default installation may have many things running that you don't really
 need.
 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Make sure you have plenty of swap space. With low, or even modest, memory,
 swap is all the more important. A general rule of thumb is twice as much swap
 as physical memory. With low memory, this is not enough. Try four times real
 memory. Or more. If you can't create more swap partitions, see the
 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mkswap</B
> man page about creating swap files instead.
 Constant disk churning is a symptom of insufficient swap space, and the
 system will be slowed as a result, sometimes drastically. Or, possibly this
 may be the symptom of a poorly behaved kernel VM system (try another kernel
 in this case).

 </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Drive performance is important for swap performance. Make sure your drive has
 DMA enabled if the drive supports it, and is otherwise tuned and performing
 up to snuff. See the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hdparm</B
> man page. Slow drive + slow
 card + low memory = slow system.
 </P

><LI
><P
> Don't use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KDE</SPAN

CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME</SPAN
>
 if memory is tight. These both require substantial memory, and are not
 required to just run <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
>. Think of these as
 usability enhancements. 32M probably may not be enough. 64M may be decent,
 depending on what other applications are being used, and other variables. 128M
 <EM
>should</EM
> be adequate in most situations. 256M or more to
 be comfortable. File Managers like <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Nautilus</SPAN
> and
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>gmc</SPAN

 </P

 resources. Use a solid color background. Avoid pixmaps or gradients for any
 kind of background, including menus, title bars, etc.

 higher values. While a ColorDepth of 24 is preferred, you probably will not

  Font servers may provide a slight performance boost by off-loading font
  rendering to the font server, while freeing the X server to do other things.
  But, the font server will use a small additional amount of memory as well.
  So, you can try it either way to see if it makes a difference.
