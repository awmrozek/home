 example) so that any applications that might expect this, have a reasonable
 choice available. Then the presence of the file <TT

 is checked, both as a system wide file and in the user's home directory. In
 this particular example, this is where any client applications are to be
 started, including a Window Manager (see below). These could just have as
 easily been started here if we had wanted to. If an
 <TT

 started for us. Either <B

 these can be started, the script would exit, and <SPAN

 doing at all. We added a few wrinkles, including starting a screen saver, a
 different terminal emulator that this user prefers (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rxvt</B

 with even more setting up of the environment (monitor, mouse and keyboard) using
 <B

 available with the system defaults. This is in the user's home directory, so
 it won't be overwritten during upgrades too.&#13;</P

 we are just putting the finishing touches on the configuration. Notice the
 Window Managers are not <SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"

 here. This is important! Something has to run in the foreground, or
 <SPAN

 in this example, like <SPAN

 <SPAN

 would have to be <B

 more complex than this, but the same principles apply.&#13;</P
