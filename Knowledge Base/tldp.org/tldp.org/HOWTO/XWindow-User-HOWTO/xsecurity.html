><P
> As mentioned, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> is essentially a networking
 protocol with graphical displaying capabilities. This makes for some
 interesting usage possibilities. And also means there are inherent security
 considerations, as there is with any networking environment. And if you ever
 connect to the Internet, you are in the midst of one very large, hostile
 network ;-)&#13;</P
><P
> X clients connect to X servers via various networking protocols, including
 TCP/IP. Even with just local connections. Possible usages here are to run an
 application on one computer, and display it on another. Or, to actually log
 in to a remote system, and have it display to your local screen, with the
 client apps using the remote system's CPU and RAM.&#13;</P
><P
> Without any precautions, this can leave you wide open to various types of
 mischief and abuse. For instance, anyone logged into to your system can
 access your <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"display"</SPAN
>, meaning they can see what you are doing
 if they want to. Thankfully, most recent Linux releases come with some
 default security precautions enabled. But it is best to make sure for
 yourself that you are protected.&#13;</P

>   Never, ever run <SPAN

   Learn to run as much as possible as a regular user, and su to root only
   when needed. This may sound like a lot of extra work (and probably is at
   first), but once the <SPAN

   it soon becomes second nature.

>   A brief anecdote from a friend: he had a client who's new system stopped 
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"working"</SPAN
>. Curiously, he found the entire
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
> directory was missing, which he re-installed and
   all was well again. He was back a few days later and found the system
   logged in as root to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
>, and someone had clicked
   on <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev</TT
> in the file manager, and dragged it onto the
   desktop. Smooth move!

   Firewalling is beyond the scope of this document, but is covered in many
   other places, including your vendor's website. <A
