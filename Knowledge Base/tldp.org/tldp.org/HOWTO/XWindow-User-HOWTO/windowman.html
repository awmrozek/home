 both have their default Window Manager, but support other, compliant Window
 Managers as well. Your distribution probably has included at least several.
 Try them all if you don't already have a favorite. Your distribution probably
 also has a method of switching dynamically between Window Managers (and Desktop
 Environments too).&#13;</P

NAME="AEN1022">6.2. Desktop Environments</H2
><P
> Desktop Environments are not really new, but their popularity has increased
 with advent of the two big names: <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KDE</SPAN
> and
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME</SPAN
>. To a certain extent, the Desktop
 Environment functionality overlaps the Window Manager's. They both can be
 responsible for the root window background, root window menu, icons,
 taskbars, etc. Generally speaking, if a Desktop Environment is running, it is
 controlling these aspects. That is the main idea behind them -- to integrate
 the various components into a cohesive, consistent whole. Desktop
 Environments also add some interoperability and ease-of-use features that a
 simple Window Manager cannot. </P
><P
> Oh, another point: Desktop Environments also try to do as much
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
> session configuration as possible. Any of their
 compliant clients will more than likely be configured by the Desktop, or have
 it's own configuration that conforms to the Desktop's style. This is at
 least partly to avoid much of the seemingly helter-skelter text file
 configuration we looked at in the above sections, and make life a little
 easier for the user.&#13;</P
><P
> There is a trade-off in this additional functionality, and that is that it
 takes memory and system resources to oversee all this. If you have plenty of
 memory and a fast computer, this is no problem. But in low memory situations,
 this can cause a slowdown (see the <A
HREF="performance.html"
>performance
 section</A
> below). 64M of RAM is probably borderline with either 
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KDE</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNOME</SPAN
>.&#13;</P
><P
> So do you need a Desktop Environment? That is up to the user. They are
 certainly not required to run <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>X</SPAN
>, but do add
 features that many users want or expect in a GUI. Which one is better? Ah,
 but that is up to you to decide!&#13;</P
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>KDE</SPAN
> has been around longer than
 <SPAN

 mature. <SPAN

 applications which share a consistent look and feel. GNOME uses GTK+ as the
 GUI toolkit for all GNOME-compliant applications.
