<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc5.1">Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> The serial port used to be found on almost all new PC's but not
anymore.  Thus as of 2008, it's becoming obsolete, if not already
obsolete.  It's often called a "legacy" device, but it's still used by
some for hardware designed to connect to the serial port especially
for computers used as servers by companies.  Laptops and Macs stopped
being sold with serial ports several years before desktops did.
However, if one needs a serial port, it's possible to buy one and
install it, such as on the USB bus, and it's still found on older
PC's.  Linux supports ordinary analog modems only if they work thru a
serial port (although the port is likely to be built into the modem)
so a PC often has a serial port even if you can't find any serial port
connector on the back of the PC.</P>
<P>The external serial port connector on the back of a PC, must pass data
via an external cable connected to that connector.  Thus it has two
interfaces: the serial-port-to-external-cable and the
serial-port-to-computer-bus.  Both of these interfaces are slow.
First we'll consider the interface via external cable to the outside
world.</P>

</H2>

<P> The conventional RS-232 serial port is inherently low speed and
is severely limited in distance.  Ads used to read "high speed" but it
can only work at "high speed" over very short distances such as to a
modem located right next to the computer.  Compared to other
connections to a PC such as as a USB bus, network card ethernet, or
IEEE 1394 (firewire), this claimed "high speed" for a serial port is
actually low speed.  All of the RS-232 serial cable wires use a common
ground return wire so that twisted-pair technology (needed for high
speeds) can't be used without additional hardware.  More modern
interfaces for serial ports exist but they are not standard on PC's
like the RS-232 is.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-22.html#non_232">Successors to RS-232</A>.  Some multiport serial cards support them.</P>
<P>It is somewhat tragic that the RS-232 standard from 1969 did not use
twisted pair technology which could operate about a hundred times
faster.  Twisted pairs have been used in telephone cables since the
late 1800's.  In 1888 (over 120 years ago) the "Cable Conference"
reported its support of twisted-pair (for telephone systems) and
pointed out its advantages.  But over 80 years after this approval by
the "Cable Conference", RS-232 failed to utilize it.   Since RS-232
was originally designed for connecting a terminal to a low speed modem
located nearby, the need for high speed and longer distance
transmission was apparently not recognized.  The result was that since
the serial port couldn't handle high speeds, new types of serial
interfaces were devised that could: Ethernet, USB, IEEE 1394, etc.
All of these use high speed twisted-pair cabling as recommended by the
"Cable Conference" of 1888.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc5.3">Inefficient PCI Interface to the Computer (in some cases)</A>
</H2>

<P> The serial port communicates with the computer via the PCI bus,
the LPC bus, X-bus, or ISA bus.  The PCI bus is now 32 or 64 bits wide,
but the serial port only sends a byte at a time (8 bits wide) which is
a waste of PCI bus bandwidth.  Not so for the LPC bus which has only a
4-bit wide bus and thus provides an efficient interface even though it
takes two transmissions to send a byte.  The ISA bus is usually
16-bits wide and the bus utilization efficiency is intermediate as
compared to efficient LPC and inefficient PCI (although ISA is overall
less efficient due to it's lower speed).</P>
