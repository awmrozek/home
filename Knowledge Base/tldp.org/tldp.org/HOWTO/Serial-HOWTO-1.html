<P> This HOWTO covers basic info about the old analog Serial Port and
multiport serial cards.  It contains much more information in it than
most people who use serial ports need to know and most people are able
to use the serial port without reading this HOWTO.  But if you're
having problems or just want to understand how it works, this is one
place to find out about it.  </P>
<P>This HOWTO is about the old and slow original serial port but it could
have been designed to be much faster.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-17.html#slow_">RS-232 Cable Is Low Speed &amp; Short Distance</A>.  It uses a UART chip and is
sometimes called a "UART serial port" to differentiate it from the
newer types of serial devices: Universal Serial Bus or IEEE 1394
(Firewire).  Information specific to devices which use serial ports:
modems, text-terminals, infrared devices, and a few printers are found
in Modem-HOWTO, Text-Terminal-HOWTO, Infrared-HOWTO, and
Printing-HOWTO.  Info on getty (the program that runs the login
process or the like) has been also moved to other HOWTOs since mgetty
and uugetty are best for modems while agetty is best for
text-terminals.  If you are dealing with a modem, text terminal,
infrared device, or printer, then you may not need to consult this
HOWTO.  But if you are using the serial port for some other device,
using a multiport serial card, trouble-shooting the serial port
itself, or want to understand more technical details of the serial
port, then you may want to use this HOWTO as well as some of the other
HOWTOs.  (See 
<A HREF="#related_howtos">Related HOWTO's</A>)  This
HOWTO lists info on various multiport serial cards.  This HOWTO
addresses Linux running on PCs (ISA and/or PCI buses), although it
might be valid for other architectures.</P>

<P> Most of the original Serial-HOWTO was written by  Greg Hankins.
<A HREF="mailto:gregh@twoguys.org">mailto:gregh@twoguys.org</A>.  He also rewrote many
contributions by others in order to maintain continuity in the writing
style and flow.  He wrote: ``Thanks to everyone who has contributed or
commented, the list of people has gotten too long to list (somewhere
over one hundred).  Special thanks to Ted Ts'o for answering questions
about the serial drivers.'' Approximately half of v2.00 was from Greg
Hankins HOWTO and the other half were additions by David Lawyer.  Ted
Ts'o has continued to be helpful.  In Jan. 2006 "Charles Brockman"
found many typos (which I fixed).</P>

<P> Since the serial port is legacy technology and much faster means of
communication exist, new versions of the Serial-HOWTO will be released
every year or so.  A list of mirror sites where you'll find copies is
at 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/mirrors.html">http://www.tldp.org/mirrors.html</A>.  If you only want to
quickly check the date of the latest version look at 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Serial-HOWTO.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Serial-HOWTO.html</A> and compare it to
this version: v2.27 December 2008 .</P>

<UL>
<LI>2.27 Dec. 2008: Changed 12 volts to 5 volts for typical serial port
voltages today.  generic_serial.ko module is not utilized by serial
drivers.  Use 8250.nr_uarts=16 etc. if serial support built into
kernel and use nr_uarts=16 if a module.  Erroneously had this
reversed.</LI>
<LI>2.26 Nov. 2008: Changed EIA-232 to RS-232.  PCI-e bus is serial.
No serial port on most new PCs.</LI>
<LI>2.25 Jan. 2007 picocom.  devfs is obsolete. ser2net.  Revised
parts on drivers as modules vs. built into kernel.  Serial Programming
wikibook.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6</A> <A HREF="Serial-HOWTO.html#toc1.6">What is a Serial Port?</A>
</H2>

<P> The conventional serial port (not the newer USB port, or 1394
port) is a very old I/O (Input/Output) port.  Until around 2006, most
new desktop PC's had one, and old PC's from the 1990's sometimes had 2
of them.  Most laptops gave up them before the desktops did.  Macs
(Apple Computer) after mid-1998 only had the USB port.  However, it's
possible, to put a conventional serial port device on the USB bus
which is on all modern PCs.</P>
<P>Each serial port has a "file" associated with it in the /dev
directory.  It isn't really a file but it seems like one.  For
example, /dev/ttyS0 (or /dev/tts/0 for the Device File System).  Other
serial ports are /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyS2, etc.  But ports on the USB
bus, multiport cards, etc. have different names.</P>
<P>The common specification for the conventional serial port is RS-232
(or RS-232).  So it's often called a "RS-232 serial port".  The
connector(s) for the serial port are often seen as one or two 9-pin
connectors (in some cases 25-pin) on the back of a PC.  But the serial
port is more than just connectors.  It includes the associated
electronics which must produce signals conforming to the RS-232
specification.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-21.html#volt_shape">Voltage Waveshapes</A>.
One pin is used to send out data bytes and another to receive data
bytes.  Another pin is a common signal ground.  The other "useful"
pins are used mainly for signalling purposes with a steady negative
voltage meaning "off" and a steady positive voltage meaning "on".</P>
<P>The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) chip does most
of the work.  Today, the functionality of this chip is usually built
into another chip.  See 
<A HREF="Serial-HOWTO-19.html#uart_">What Are UARTs?</A> These
have improved over time and old models (prior to say 1994) are very
obsolete.</P>
<P>The serial port was originally designed for connecting external modems
to a PC but it's used to connect many other devices also such as mice,
text-terminals, some printers, etc. to a computer.  You just plug
these devices into the serial port using the correct cable.  Many
internal modem cards have a built-in serial port so when you install
one inside your PC it's as if you just installed another serial port
in your PC.</P>
<P>The serial port is part of what Linux kernel programmers call the "tty
layer".  The text interface using the console on a PC is also part of
the tty layer.  Starting in 2005, Alan Cox and others made major
improvements to this tty layer.  A significant amount of work still
was underway in 2008 to eliminate bugs including "race conditions" in
this layer.</P>
