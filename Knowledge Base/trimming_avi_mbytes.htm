Have you ever come across an AVI
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave> file which is just
a few megabytes too large to fit on a CD or a DVD? Well I have… and in
this post I'll go over a crude solution to this problem. That is, I'll
assume that the very end of the AVI file is not that important and I'll
simply trim it off. Of course, an alternate solution is to re-encode the
file at a lower bit-rate. However, trimming seems just so much simpler.

So, lets say we want to get rid of trailing 32 MB of a 731 MB AVI file:
video.avi. To achieve this we can use shell`s |head| command as follows.

head --bytes=-32m video.avi > trimmed.avi

Now lets compare the sizes of video.avi and trimmed.avi using the
following command.

du -sh video.avi trimmed.avi

Here is the output of the above command.

731M    video.avi
699M    trimmed.avi

So that worked great. However, by trimming the AVI file we broke its
internal index and we are left with a more or less raw AVI stream. You
can still play it in mplayer <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/> like so:

mplayer -fs -zoom trimmed.avi

But you no longer can seek inside it, i.e. it is not possible to seek
forward or backward. If you do try to seek then mplayer will produce the
following error message.

Cannot seek in raw AVI streams. (Index required, try with the -idx switch.)

You could give mplayer the suggested -idx switch, like so

mplayer -fs -zoom -idx trimmed.avi

The mplayer would then rebuild the index on the fly before playback.
This is instant on current CPUs, but can be quite slow on older
hardware. It is also possible to fix the indexing permanently in the
trimmed file using mencoder as follows.

mencoder -idx trimmed.avi -oac copy -ovc copy -o fixed.avi

Now forward and backward seeking works just fine. Ok, lets create an ISO
image <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image> containing the AVI file.
This is done using the following command.

mkisofs -r -o video.iso fixed.avi

Last step is to burn the ISO to a CD. This can be done in many ways,
I'll use a shell tool: cdrecord
<http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8831>. If you prefer to work with
GUI apps then try K3b <http://k3b.plainblack.com/>. With cdrecord I'll
have to locate my DVD+-RW device identifier first before burning the CD.
The following command is used for this purpose.

cdrecord -scanbus

Here is the fragment of the output that is of interest to us.

scsibus2:
        2,0,0   200) 'HL-DT-ST' 'DVD+-RW GSA-H73N' 'B103' Removable CD-ROM

Now, the following command is used to burn the ISO image to a CD.

cdrecord -v dev=2,0,0 video.iso

Here is a quick summary of steps involved in trimming an over-sized AVI
file and burning its ISO to a CD.

head --bytes=-32m video.avi > trimmed.avi
mencoder -idx trimmed.avi -oac copy -ovc copy -o fixed.avi
mkisofs -r -o video.iso fixed.avi
DEVID=`cdrecord -scanbus 2>/dev/null |grep 'DVD.*RW' |awk '{ print $1 }'`
cdrecord -v dev=$DEVID video.iso

Enjoy!
