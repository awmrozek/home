Besides being a great video player, MPlayer also comes with a great
utility for converting video files to different formats. You can use
mencoder via the command line or in conjunction with one of the many
user interfaces available for it, but CLI has obvious advantages over a
predefined GUI because of the options it gives the user. I can't think
of a single video filetype that mencoder couldn't convert for me when I
needed it. I used to launch mencoder strings years ago when I needed
movies that would play nicely on my PocketPC, now I use it to convert
movies for my iPod Touch or simply convert a YouTube video from Flash to
something playable with any video player.

Be it MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO,
FLI or FLV, mencoder can turn it into something else, resize it, amplify
the volume, compress the video part or append it to a second one. Let's
see what mencoder can do with a few simple options.

mencoder video.mpg -o video.avi -ovc lavc -oac lavc

The above command will turn a MPG file into an AVI file. The -ovc and
-oac options represent the video and audio codecs you can use. To find
out what codecs you can currently use, do a

mencoder -ovc help

for video and a

mencoder -oac help

for the audio part.For example, the first command will output
information about the available video codecs:

cypress@brunner:~$ mencoder -ovc helpMEncoder 2:1.0~rc2-0ubuntu17 (C)
2000-2007 MPlayer TeamCPU: Genuine Intel(R) CPU T2400 @ 1.83GHz (Family:
6, Model: 14, Stepping: 8)CPUflags: Type: 6 MMX: 1 MMX2: 1 3DNow: 0
3DNow2: 0 SSE: 1 SSE2: 1Compiled with runtime CPU detection.Available
codecs: copy - frame copy, without re-encoding. Doesn't work with
filters. frameno - special audio-only file for 3-pass encoding, see
DOCS. raw - uncompressed video. Use fourcc option to set format
explicitly. nuv - nuppel video lavc - libavcodec codecs - best quality!
vfw - VfW DLLs, read DOCS/HTML/en/encoding-guide.html. qtvideo -
QuickTime DLLs, currently only SVQ1/3 are supported. libdv - DV encoding
with libdv v0.9.5 xvid - XviD encoding x264 - H.264 encodingSimilarly,
the audio codecs available on my system are as follows:Available codecs:
copy - frame copy, without re-encoding (useful for AC3) pcm -
uncompressed PCM audio mp3lame - cbr/abr/vbr MP3 using libmp3lame lavc -
FFmpeg audio encoder (MP2, AC3, ...) faac - FAAC AAC audio encoder

Great! So I can create an XviD file with an MP3 audio track, which is
what most people would probably need. But what if i need uncompressed
audio instead of MP3? Then I'd use

mencoder file.mpg -o file.avi -ovc lavc -oac lavc -lavcopts acodec=pcm

Returning to compressed audio, you can even specify the audio bitrate by
using the abitrate option:

mencoder file.mpg -o file.avi -ovc lavc -oac lavc -lavcopts
acodec=libmp3lame:abitrate=128

Mencoder can also output VBR (Variable BitRate):

mencoder file -o file.avi -ovc lavc -oac mp3lame -lameopts vbr=2:q=3

(where q can be any number between 0 and 9)Same goes for the video part:

mencoder file.mpg -o file.avi -ovc lavc -oac lavc -lavcopts
acodec=libmp3lame:abitrate=128 vcodec=xvid

If you do not wish to compress the video part, use vcodec=copy and the
frames will simply be copied piece by piece from the source file. If
you'd rather wish to adjust the quality of the video part, use the
bitrate option:

mencoder -ovc xvid -oac mp3lame -xvidencopts bitrate=878 -o
destination_file.avi source_file.avi

The higher the bitrate, the bigger the resulting file and better the
quality. To mantain quality and still obtain a smaller file size, use
the two-pass mode:

mencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1 -o
/dev/nullmencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -ovc xvid -xvidencopts
pass=2:*bitrate*=800 -o file.avi

Adjust the bitrate part to your liking. When wishing to convert a movie
DVD to a standard 700MB AVI file, I'd use

mencoder dvd:// -ovc xvid -oac mp3lame -xvidencopts bitrate=-700000 -o
file.avi

This will put your CPU to the test and you cand go and have a beer until
it finishes because you won't be able to do anything else on your
computer while this is running. A workaround would be to use a niceness
level for the process to be able at least to read some e-mails or browse
the web:

nice -n 19 mencoder dvd:// -ovc xvid -oac mp3lame -xvidencopts
bitrate=-700000 -o file.aviWhat else can you do with mencoder?

Answer: a lot of things. Let's say you have a bunch of JPG files laying
around in a folder and would like - for whatever reason - to join them
into an AVI file with a framerate of 24. One command you could use would be

mencoder "mf://*.jpg" -mf fps=24 -o file.avi

Or maybe you'd like to append multiple video files one unto another.
Just rename them accordingly so that they follow the order you wish them
to be displayed in and do a simple

mencoder * -o output.avi

in the directory that contains them.If you want to create a presentation
video with a custom soundtrack, just put the video file and an MP3 file
in the same directory and do a

mencoder source_video.avi -o destination_video.avi -ovc copy -oac copy
-audiofile audio_file.mp3

Mencoder helped me a lot with converting video files for the 320x240
screen of PocketPC devices. For example, if I wanted the resulting video
to expand upon the entire screen, i would do a

mencoder -oac mp3lame -lameopts mode=3:preset=24 -ovc lavc -lavcopts
vcodec=mpeg4:vhq:vbitrate=384:keyint=250 -vop expand="320:240" -o
output.avi input.avi

If I wanted the movie to constrain proportions the command I would use
would be

mencoder input.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts
vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=200:abitrate=48 -vop scale=320:240 -oac copy -o
output.avi

With mencoder you can even record what your plugged-in webcam is "seeing":

mencoder tv:// -tv
driver=v4l:device=/dev/video0:width=640:height=480:forceaudio -ovc lavc
-oac lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:acodec=mp3 -ffourcc divx -o test.avi

Too sleepy tonight but still want to catch that show you love? Record it
for later with mencoder and your TVtuner card:

mencoder tv:// -v -tv
driver=v4l:width=720:height=576:input=1:device=/dev/video0:immediatemode=0:
/alsa:adevice=hw.0,0:outfm t=yv12 -o resulting_file.avi -af volume=10:0
-ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg:aspect=4/3 -aspect 4:3 -oac pcm -endpos
02:00:00

The command above will keep recording for two hours then save the file.

Conclusion

As you can see, mencoder is Linux's multimedia army knife. The resulting
output of a file depends only on how well you used mencoder's options
and the possibilities for scripting are endless. Just imagine how much a
company would gain to have detailed video records of their office video
cameras by using just a dozen cheap webcams and an old PC running as a
mencoder server.

If the command line has no appeal to you, try one of the following

writen by: *sanjay* on 2009-03-23 01:46:57
HI, I have a requirement where I want to extract the elementary stream
contents from the AVI content. Because usually AVI is a program stream
which generally contain mpeg4+aac / h264+aac / h264+mp3 streams inside.
So I'm interested in the elementary stream quality ananysis. will
mencoder able to this
