The Java Archive (JAR) File Format


  Using JAR Files: The Basics

JAR files are packaged with the ZIP file format, so you can use them for
"ZIP-like" tasks such as lossless data compression, archiving,
decompression, and archive unpacking. These are among the most common
uses of JAR files, and you can realize many JAR file benefits using only
these basic features.

Even if you want to take advantage of advanced functionality provided by
the JAR file format such as electronic signing, you'll first need to
become familiar with the fundamental operations.

To perform basic tasks with JAR files, you use the Java Archive Tool
provided as part of the Java Development Kit. Because the Java Archive
tool is invoked by using the |jar| command, for convenience we'll call
it the "Jar tool".

As a synopsis and preview of some of the topics to be covered in this
lesson, the following table summarizes common JAR-file operations:

Operation 	Command
To create a JAR file	|jar cf /jar-file input-file(s)/|
To view the contents of a JAR file	|jar tf /jar-file/|
To extract the contents of a JAR file	|jar xf /jar-file/|
To extract specific files from a JAR file	|jar xf /jar-file
archived-file(s)/|
To run an application packaged as a JAR file
(version 1.1) 	

jre -cp /app.jar MainClass/

To run an application packaged as a JAR file
(version 1.2 -- requires |Main-Class|
manifest header) 	

java -jar /app.jar/

To invoke an applet packaged as a JAR file 	

<applet code=/AppletClassName.class/
        archive="/JarFileName.jar/"
        width=/width/ height=/height/>
</applet>

This lesson will show you how to perform the most common JAR-file
operations, with examples for each of the basic features:


        Creating a JAR File
        </developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/basics/build.html>

This section shows you how to use the Jar tool to package files and
directories into a JAR file.


        Viewing the Contents of a JAR File
        </developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/basics/view.html>

You can display a JAR file's table of contents to see what it contains
without actually unpacking the JAR file.


        Extracting the Contents of a JAR File
        </developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/basics/unpack.html>

You can use the Jar tool to unpack a JAR file. When extracting files,
the Jar tool makes copies of the desired files and writes them to the
current directory, reproducing the directory structure that the files
have in the archive.


        Modifying a Manifest File
        </developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/basics/mod.html>

This section shows you a couple of ways that you can modify the contents
of a JAR file's manifest. You might want to modify the manifest, for
example, to enable special JAR-file functionality.


        Updating a JAR File
        </developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/basics/update.html>

The Jar tool in version 1.2 of the Java Development Kit provides a new
functionality for updating the contents of an existing JAR file by
modifying its manifest or by adding files. This section shows you how
use this new feature.


        Running JAR-Packaged Software
        </developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/basics/run.html>

This section shows you how to invoke and run applets and applications
that are packaged in JAR files.


        Understanding the Manifest
        </developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/basics/manifest.html>

Some of the more advanced features offered by the JAR file format such
as package sealing and electronic signing are made possible by the JAR
file's /manifest/, a special file that JAR files contain. In the final
section of this lesson, you'll find basic information about the
structure and uses of the manifest file.
